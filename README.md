# Stroke-Prediction
Built a machine learning model to predict stroke risk using features like age, hypertension, BMI, and glucose level. Used preprocessing, SMOTE for class imbalance, and trained models including Random Forest and XGBoost. Achieved high accuracy and ROC-AUC, enabling early detection for effective preventive healthcare.
