# 🧠 Stroke Prediction Model

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having a stroke using various health and demographic features. It leverages machine learning models to assist in early diagnosis and preventive care.

## 📁 Dataset Features
- Age
- Gender
- Hypertension
- Heart Disease
- Marital Status
- Work Type
- Residence Type
- Average Glucose Level
- BMI
- Smoking Status
- Stroke (Target Variable)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, normalization)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
3. Model training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
4. Tackled class imbalance using SMOTE
5. Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

## ✅ Results
Achieved high prediction performance (accuracy and ROC-AUC) with Random Forest/XGBoost, making it effective for early stroke risk screening.

## 📂 How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stroke-prediction-model.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and test the model.
